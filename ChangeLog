Run './configure --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no' for use with 
ValGrind. Run 'valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./test'

To do:
- make tifiles_calc_are_compat more powerful
- add tifiles_file_is_targetted(filename, model, class) avec class = ALL
- API: préciser que les varnames sont en UTF-8 !
- tigroup: g_fopen/fopen in ZIP I/O callbacks to fix

Log:

- 06/07/2006, version 0.2.1: roms
	- bug #1499672: every edit-locked BASIC and AMS program is marked ASM
	and received as *.8xz, of course this has to be *.8xp for both locked 
	BASIC and ASM.

- 17/06/2006, version 0.2.0: roms
	- full TiGroup support (both regular & flash with deflate compression)

- 05/06/2006, version 0.1.5: roms
	- renamed stdints.h into stdints2.h
	
- 16/05/2006, version 0.1.4: roms

- 16/04/2006, version 0.1.3: roms
	- thanks to O. Armand, fixed a bug in the file attribute (archived flag)
	- ti8x_read_flash now returns in FlashContent.data_length the length of pure data
		instead of file size (TI8x FLASH file format)

- 07/04/2006, version 0.1.2: roms
	- increased buffer length of variable & folder names (9 -> 36) due to TI-UTF-8

	- tifiles_file_write_regular can now auto-saves files with greek characters

- 02/02/2006, version 0.0.6: roms

	- pass CalcModel to 'tifiles_content_create_xxxx' => increased so major number

	- added functions for adding/removing entr(y)ies in regular file

			internal fields in FileContent structure (make them opaque/private)

	- removed a limitation in 'tifiles_group_contents': the src content is now
		fully copied (not limited to first element like single file)
