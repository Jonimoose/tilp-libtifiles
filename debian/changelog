libtifiles2-4 (1.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  - fixed bug in ticalcs_dirlist_destroy: don't free TreeInfo when tree has no folder
	- replaced malloc/free by g_malloc/g_free
	- replaced TNode by GNode as provided by GLib
	- changed args for ticalcs_dirlist_ve_exist, otherwise this function is buggy 
		with TI8x varnames (like lists due to presence of the '\' character)
	- fixed bug in ticalcs_dirlist_ve_add when no folder exists yet
	- wrong battery status (debug)
	- no clock in TI83+ (SE); no clock in TI84+, too (not handled yet)
