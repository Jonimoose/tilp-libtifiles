Type=Function
Header=file_int.h
Definition=void* tifiles_malloc (size_t size);

[Parameters]
size : the size of the block to allocate

[Summary]
Acts like the 'malloc' function.

[Explanation]
Due to DLL partition under Windows, any memory freed by the library must have been allocated in the library else a memory violation is raised.
To circumvent this problem, a platform independant 'calloc' function has been created.
