Name=tifiles_realloc
Type=Function
Header=file_int.h
Definition=void* tifiles_realloc (void *ptr, size_t size);

[Parameters]
ptr : a ptr on an allocated block
size : the new size of the block

[Summary]
Acts like the 'realloc' function.

[Explanation]
Due to DLL partition under Windows, any memory freed by the library must have been allocated in the library else a memory violation is raised.
To circumvent this problem, a platform independant 'calloc' function has been created.
