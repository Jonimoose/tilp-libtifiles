[Summary]
A generic structure used to store a TI formated file.

[Description]
This structure is used by many functions which need to manipulate TI files (at least the single/group files, embrassed as regular files).
This structure is generic, that is to say common to all calcs.

Some fields can be manipulated by the developer:
<br>- calc_type
<br>- default_folder
<br>- comment
<br>- num_entries
<br>- entries
<br>the others are internally used:
<br>- checksum
