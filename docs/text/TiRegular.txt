[Summary]
A generic structure used to store a TI formatted file.

[Description]
This structure is used by many functions which need to manipulate TI files (at least the single/group files, embrassed as regular files).
This structure is generic, that is to say common to all calcs.

Some fields can be manipulated by the developer:
- calc_type
- default_folder
- comment
- num_entries
- entries
the others are internally used:
- checksum
