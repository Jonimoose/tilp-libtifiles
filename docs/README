- tmpl: html template (style sheet, images) + hand-written doc
- text: hand-written documentation with a specific format


About the documentation system...

It's inspired from the TIGCC system but parsing functions has been written
from scratch with awk.

It's made up of sections [...]: 
- Main
- Parameters or Fields: functions parameters or structure fields are listed
- Summary
- Description
- See also: other links

In the Main section, there are some keywords:
- Name: some text
- Type: Structure, Function, Define, Enum
- Header: one or more 'C' headers
- Definition: some text

There are some specific chars:
- '@': parameters reference such as @ticable_init@

There are some aliases to avoid ambiguity:
TicableLinkCable.get -> get

The 3 folders are processed in 2 passes and the result is put in the 
'doc' folder:

        text + tmpl -> html -+-> doc
        html                -+

Pass #1 (pass1.awk): text -> html
Pass #2 (pass2.awk): html -> html
