<h1> General Information about the TiFiles library </h1>
<hr>
<pre>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></pre>
The TiFiles library is a part of the <a href="http://www.tilp.info">TiLP</a>
project and constitutes with the other libraries a complete framework
for developping linking and/or TI files oriented applications.<br>
<br>
<h3>Overview </h3>
The tifiles library is a library capable of reading/modifying/writing
TI formatted files. It can also group/ungroups files.<br>
This library is able to manipulate files in a fairly transparent
fashion. With this library, the developer does not have to worry about
the different file formats . <br>
The library provides a complete API which is very easy to use and makes
things easier.<br>
<br>
The library supports all the currently available calculators and their
associated file formats:<br>
- TI8x calculators: TI73, 82, 83, TI83+, 85 and 86 (with 2 sub-classes:
TI73/83+ &amp; 85/86).<br>
- TI9x calculators: TI89, 92, 92+ and V200PLT.<br>
<br>
This library has already been used by various projects (such as TiLP,
TiEmu) and by other developers (the Ti Winamp project, for instance).
The list of developers/users can be viewed on the TiLP web site
(Developers section).<br>
<br>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Requirements </h3>
At the time being, this library is dependant of the GLib (version 2.x).<br>
<br>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3> Bug Reports </h3>
There may still be some bugs in the library, please send an email to
TiLP development <a href="mailto:tilp-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">mailing
list</a>.<br>
<br>
<h3> History </h3>
This library is a part of the TiLP project. I have been working for 3
years on TiLP as well as on some other projects (TiEmu, TiGCC).<br>
I wroten this library for several reasons:<br>
- split code,<br>
- share code between my various project,<br>
- provide source code to others.<br>
<br>
As most of Linux programs, I maintain a file which lists modifications.
This is called a ChangeLog that you can find <a
 href="file:///home/devel/tilp_project/libs/cables/docs/text/ChangeLog.html">here</a>.<br>
